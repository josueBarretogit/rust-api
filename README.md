[Rust consume menos energia que la mayoria de lenguages de programacion](https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/opensource/sustainability-with-rust/)
"What the study did is implement 10 benchmark problems in 27 different programming languages and measure execution time, energy consumption, and peak memory use. C and Rust significantly outperformed other languages in energy efficiency. In fact, they were roughly 50% more efficient than Java and 98% more efficient than Python."
